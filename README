This little program takes some C/C++ source files* as input and produces simple
line counts as its output. I'm always interested in how many lines of code I've
written and how it compares to my (often verbose) comments. clines tells you how
many lines of your code are code lines, strictly comment lines and whitespace
lines.

Here's a sample run on a single file:
./clines testfile
testfile
Code              3       13%
Comment          15       68%
Blank             4       18%
Total            22      100%

And a sample run on multiple files:
./clines testfile clines.c
testfile
Code              3       13%
Comment          15       68%
Blank             4       18%
Total            22      100%

clines.c
Code            107       68%
Comment          31       19%
Blank            19       12%
Total           157      100%

Totals
Code            110       61%
Comment          46       25%
Blank            23       12%
Total           179      100%

* This essentially works for any language that uses C-like comments, i.e. single
line comments with '// ...' and multiline comments with '/* ... */'.
