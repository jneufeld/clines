This little program takes some C source files as input and produces simple line
counts as its output. I'm always interested in how many lines of code I've
written, and how it compares to my (often verbose) comments. clines tells you
how many lines of your code are code lines, how many are strictly comment lines
and how many whitespace lines are in a file.

Here's a couple sample runs:

./clines testfile
testfile
Code              4       19%
Comment          14       66%
Blank             3       14%
Total            21      100%

./clines testfile clines.c
testfile
Code              4       19%
Comment          14       66%
Blank             3       14%
Total            21      100%

clines.c
Code            108       69%
Comment          30       19%
Blank            18       11%
Total           156      100%

Woo!
