This little program takes some C/C++ source files* as input and produces simple
line counts as its output. I'm always interested in how many lines of code I've
written and how it compares to my (often verbose) comments. clines tells you how
many lines of your code are code lines, strictly comment lines and whitespace
lines.

Here's a sample run on a single file:
./clines testfile
testfile
Code              4       19%
Comment          14       66%
Blank             3       14%
Total            21      100%

And a sample run on multiple files:
./clines testfile clines.c
testfile
Code              4       19%
Comment          14       66%
Blank             3       14%
Total            21      100%

clines.c
Code            112       68%
Comment          32       19%
Blank            19       11%
Total           163      100%

Totals
Code            116       63%
Comment          46       25%
Blank            22       11%
Total           184      100%

* This essentially works for any language that uses C-like comments, i.e. single
line comments with '// ...' and multiline comments with '/* ... */'.
